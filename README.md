## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis, also known as Requirements Engineering, is the foundational and most critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It is a systematic process of discovering, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and constraints that a new software system must satisfy.

Think of it as the "blueprint" phase of building a house. Before a single brick is laid, architects and engineers work with the future homeowners to understand their needs: how many bedrooms, the flow of the kitchen, the direction of sunlight, plumbing, electrical needs, etc. Requirement Analysis does the same for software; it ensures that developers, testers, and stakeholders are all aligned on what will be built, why it's needed, and for whom, before any code is written.

The core objective is to minimize ambiguity and create a clear, precise, and agreed-upon set of requirements that will guide the entire project.

Importance of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC:
1. Establishes a Clear Project Scope and Vision
2. Reduces Cost and Rework
3. Forms the Basis for Planning and Estimation
